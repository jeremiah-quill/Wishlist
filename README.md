## Description
Wishlist is a website designed to take the hassle out of holiday party planning. It allows the user to create an account, create a wishlist, create a group, join a group, and see others wishlists. Wishlist allows the user to edit and update their personal wishlist in an easy and intuitive way. It also gives people the ability to be reminded of upcoming party details via email. Once members have all joined, the creator is able to randomly draw names of group members for gift exchange games, allowing each user to see the wishlist of the person they drew.
